# Open Source Agreement [OSA, 2024, Celluarbyte (Representative for CellSoftware)]
By using "uTerminal" you agree that you can't charge access to it and a dev environment should be completely accessible to a normal user, if your gonna edit uTerminal, fork it. uTerminal copies should at least be Open-Source, so just fork this repo.
<br>You agree to this by editing uTerminal.
# Plugins
